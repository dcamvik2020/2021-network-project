# 2021-best_network-project_ever



## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This project was created for MIPT network course in the 7th term with my classmate https://github.com/Dionidgy. It's a 2 players game RSP (Rock, Scissors, Paper) using network, so players can locate anywhere.


## Current condition
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We need to start server.py first. After that the players can connect to it.
+ first player connects to server and sees start menu with words 'Click to start'
+ second player connects to server and sees start menu with words 'Click to start'
+ both click and start playing : they need to choose R, S or P
+ the winner sees "You Won!", loser sees "You Lost..." and the game restarts infinitely
+ the game stops when one of the players closes his window


## The basic idea
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To be added ... maybe

## Roadmap
+ add nicknames for players
+ add scores for players
